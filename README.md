# Installation 🚀🚀🚀

### TLDR; 🤚

If you just want to run the project, with default settings, run the following command:

```bash
make first-defaults
```

### Instructions: 👾

In case that you want to customize ports and hosts:

```bash
cp docker-compose.yaml.dist docker-compose.yaml
```

Do your changes in `docker-compose.yaml` file. 

Then run:

```bash
make first
```

And finally, if you don't want to use `make`, you can look at [manual installation instructions](/docs/manual_installation).
