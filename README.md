# Description 📝

I received a task to complete as part of a job recruitment process.
I had fun with it, and at the same time it proves couple of my skills,
so I decided to put the code on GitHub.

# Installation 🚀🚀🚀

### TLDR; 🤚

If you just want to run the project, with default settings, run the following command:

```bash
$ make first-defaults
```

### Instructions: 👾

In case that you want to customize ports and hosts:

```bash
$ cp docker-compose.yaml.dist docker-compose.yaml
```

Do your changes in `docker-compose.yaml` file. 

Then run:

```bash
$ make first
```

And finally, if you don't want to use `make`, you can look at [manual installation instructions](/docs/manual_installation.md).
